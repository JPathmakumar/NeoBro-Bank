NeoBro-Bank — Project Description

NeoBro-Bank is a simple, front-end banking simulation website designed for learning, experimenting, and demonstrating basic UI concepts for a digital banking system.
The project includes individual account pages, an admin dashboard, and styled components made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

It allows users to view a mock balance, name, and account info, while the admin panel provides quick access to each user page.
NeoBro-Bank is focused on design and structure — it does not include real backend banking functions.
The project is ideal for students or beginners who want to understand how a banking interface can be built with basic web technologies.
